This project is a fork of two open source projects. If you'd like, give them some love:
- http://www.portaudio.com/
- https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/

# Usage

See the [example](https://github.com/intxcc/pyaudio_portaudio/tree/master/example).

Exactly like the official PyAudio but with the extra option "as_loopback" which expects a boolean.
```python
import pyaudio
p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
stream = p.open([...], as_loopback = True)
```

# How to install?

### You can find the precompiled PyAudio build, static linked with PortAudio, as well as only the static linked PortAudio in the [release](https://github.com/intxcc/pyaudio_portaudio/releases).

I will try to rebuild the project on each update from one of the used projects.

# How to build?

## Cygwin

You will need a working cygwin installation with basic developer tools and python.

#### Step 0
You might have to change all files to use LF line endings with
```bash
find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/\x0d//g' {} \+
```

#### Step 1
Change to */pyaudio/portaudio-v19* and type
```bash
./configure --with-winapi=wasapi --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no
make loopback
```

To rebuild type
```bash
make clean
make loopback
```

#### Step 2
Change to /pyaudio and type
```bash
python setup.py install --static-link
```

## Microsoft Visual Studio (2017)

You will need to include the python executable in PATH.

### Step 1

- Open the portaudio project located in *pyaudio\portaudio-v19\build\msvc\portaudio.sln*.
- Open the project configuration and make sure that the configuration type is set to static library.
- Select the build type __Release__ and __x64__. Then build the project.
- Make sure the build was succesful and the file *pyaudio\portaudio-v19\build\msvc\x64\ReleaseDLL\portaudio.lib* does exist.

### Step 2

Open the PowerShell __as administrator__ and change the directory. Then you can build and install pyaudio with portaudio:

```
cd <Location of the repository>\pyaudio_portaudio\pyaudio
```

- Create wheel: pip wheel . --wheel-dir build
- Install: python3.12 -m pip install .
- For <= Python3.10: python3.10 .\setup.py install --static-link

## Microsoft Visual Studio - 32 bit\

1. Open *pyaudio\portaudio-v19\build\msvc\portaudio.sln* in Visual Studio
2. Select build type __ReleaseDLL__ and __Win32__
3. Build the project (F6)
4. Install library
    ```
    python setup.py install
    ```
5. Create Installable Wheel (recommended)
    ```
    python setup.py bdist_wheel
    ```

For 32-bit support see [this issue](https://github.com/intxcc/pyaudio_portaudio/issues/8)
